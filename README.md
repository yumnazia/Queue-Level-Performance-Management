# Queue-Level-Performance-Management
A Python based Performance Report - As this was a work-based project, I've included here is a sample HTML report that is shared at the end of code execution highlighting overall performance for the queue. 
The alert is divided into three parts, 
- Plots: This page shares call volume, gain (performance), coversion rate (percentage of calls that were successful - generated a positive outcome), disposition rate (proportion of calls with valid outcome)
- Summarized performance summary broken into different durations for assessment along with model update dates for each individual model operating on the queue
- Detailed performance divided by site.
